CURRENT LOOP EXECUTION:

LOOP TO SET MASTER TO ZERO												SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION

LOOP EACH TRACK	IN ARRANGEMENT											NUMTRACKS
	- LOOP TO SET SAMPLEBUFFER TO ZERO									SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION
	- LOOP EACH TRACK													SONGLENGTH
		- LOOP EACH NOTE IN SEQUENCE									TOTALLENGTH / TRACK->LENGTH * SAMPLE_RATE / SEQ-> TEMPO
			- LOOP EACH SAMPLE IN NOTE									SEQ->TONES[1] * SAMPLE_RATE / SEQ->TEMPO
	- LOOP TO ADD SAMPLEBUFFER TO MASTER								SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION

																		SONGLENGTH * NOTES_IN_SEQ * SAMPLES_IN_NOTE = SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION

TOTAL TIME: (NUMTRACKS * 3 * SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION) + (SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION)


BETTER LOOP EXECUTION

LOOP TO SET SAMPLEBUFFER TO ZERO										SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION

LOOP EACH TRACK IN ARRANGEMENT											NUMTRACKS
	- LOOP OVER SAMPLEBUFFER AND ADD SAMPLE VALUE FOR EACH NOTE			SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION

TOTAL TIME: (NUMTRACKS * SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION) + (SAMPLE_RATE * DURATION)
